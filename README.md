# Description
This project contains the files I used to learn LESS and SASS (sassy).

## LESS File
I learnt LESS from **[Shawn Wildermuth](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/shawn-wildermuth)** in his course [Less: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/less-getting-started) on [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com).
